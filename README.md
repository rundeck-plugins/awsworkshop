# AWS Workshop Content

This project contains content used in our AWS Automation Workshops. More information about how to sign up will be coming soon.

## Repository Structure

This is a Rundeck project export containing:
- Job definitions (XML files)
- Project configuration files (YAML)
- Workshop documentation and resources

**Note**: This repository contains configuration and documentation files only - no executable code with dependencies. Security scanning tools like Snyk may not find supported target files, which is expected behavior for this type of project.
